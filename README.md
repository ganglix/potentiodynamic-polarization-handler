# Potentiodynamic-polarization-handler
## Description 
Python Version Required: Python 3.8 anaconda

The Tafel_LPR_fit_notebook_IRcomp_IFilm.py file serves as A customized Python module for interactive curving fitting in Jupyter Notebook environment right in the browser such as Chrome. 

It allows users to interactively fit Butler-Volmer equations and its variations to potentiodynamic scan curves. The optimization process is powered by non-linear least squares algorithms from Scipy. It features an user-friendly plotting GUI with Jupyter Notebook widgets. This current release provides options for interactive data range selection, linear/log axis switching, auto-zoomed plotting, and post-IR compensation. The fitted results include corrosion parameters such as Ecorr, Icorr, Ba, Bc, B, Rp, and fitting goodness (R2 score and Chi2 score).
